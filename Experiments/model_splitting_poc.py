VALIDATION STRATEGY: Hidden State Equivalence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why we only compare output[0] (the 'Hidden State'):

In a Transformer model, data flows through layers like a relay race. 
The 'Hidden State' is the 'baton' a 3D tensor containing the model's 
compressed conceptual understanding of the input at that specific layer.

1. The 'Source of Truth':
   Each layer in the Transformer is mathematically defined to receive 
   the hidden state from the previous layer as its primary input. 
   If our split is successful, the input to Layer 15 (our 'partial pass') 
   must be identical to the input Layer 15 would have received in a 
   standard, continuous execution.

2. Defining Equivalence:
   Because the model is a deterministic chain of mathematical operations, 
   the 'Hidden State' is the sole driver of the next layer's output. If the 
   Hidden State at Layer 14 is identical (within floating-point tolerance), 
   then the output of Layer 15, 16, and all subsequent layers is guaranteed 
   to be identical, regardless of whether the model was run in one piece 
   or split into chunks.

3. Ignoring Auxiliary Data:
   While each layer returns a tuple (a package containing hidden states, 
   attention weights, and cache objects), only the hidden state (index 0) 
   feeds into the next layer's 'forward' function. The auxiliary data acts 
   as 'spectator' information for this specific workflow. Comparing the 
   Hidden State alone is sufficient to prove that our model-splitting logic 
   maintains the mathematical integrity of the entire inference pipeline.

def capture_stopped_pass():
    """
    Executes the model up to the specified stopping layer and captures the 
    state required to resume execution downstream.

    This function interrupts the model's forward pass after layer 14 finishes,
    preventing the execution of all subsequent layers (15-28). It extracts
    the 'hand-off' package containing the hidden state and the necessary 
    positional context to ensure the resumption remains mathematically 
    consistent with the original pass.

    Rationale for Positional Context:
    Transformers require positional information (position_ids and 
    position_embeddings) to interpret the sequence of tokens. This metadata 
    is computed globally at Layer 0 and is static throughout the model. 
    Because Layer 15 (the resumption point) is decoupled from the initial 
    input process, it lacks access to this original context. We must 
    explicitly capture and inject these constants to ensure the attention 
    mechanisms and RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings) calculations function 
    correctly when the partial pass resumes.

    Returns:
        tuple: A triplet containing:
            - hidden_state (Tensor): The 3D hidden state output from layer 14.
