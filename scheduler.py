scheduler.py

Round-robin query interleaving for pipeline-parallel inference.

The Scheduler holds a queue of InFlightRequest objects. Each iteration
it picks the highest-priority request (decode before prefill, then
round-robin by least-recently-stepped), runs one forward step, and
moves to the next.

This lets multiple users see tokens streaming simultaneously instead
of one user blocking everyone until their full response is done.
